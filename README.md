Machine Learning for Flight Delay Prediction

Introduction

Thousands of passengers commute everyday by flight. In the modern world air traffic has become
very common due to the increase in the number of passengers. In this fast moving world time is
everything and people canâ€™t risk of losing it. The arrival and departure of a flight is dependent on
several factors and one major factor would be the weather condition. This project discusses about
the accurate methods involved for classifying whether a flight will be delayed and predicting the
arrival delay in minutes using Machine learning
